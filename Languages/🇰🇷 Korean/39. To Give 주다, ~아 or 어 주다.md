# 주다
- `주다` means *to give*

- we can attach imperative ending from [[38. The Imperative Mood]]
	- `그 책을 (나에게) 줘`
	- `그 책을 (나에게) 줘라` *(pronounced as 주라)*
	- `그 책을 (나에게) 주세요`
	- *Give me that book*

# Verb stem + ~아/어 주다
- by adding `~아/어 주다` to a stem of a word, you imply that the action is beneficial to you

	- `그 선생님은 한국어를 저에게 그르쳐 줬어요`
	- *The teacher taught me Korean (the 2nd example implied some services/favor by teaching you)*
- if you want someone to do something for you, you can first add `~아/어 주다` to the stem and add an imperative ending to `주다`

# Using 주다 with Negative Imperative Sentences
- You can tell a person **not** to do something by adding `~지 말다` to the stem of word
	- `그것을 말하지 말아 주세요`
	- *Please don't say that*
- You can also add `~아/어 지다` after `~지 말다` to have the same effect, but the speaker is emphasizing that the listener provided some sort of favor by **not** doing the damn action
	- `제 엉덩이를 만지지 말아 주세요`
	- *Please don't touch my ass*
