# Using `「（で）さえ」`　to describe the minimum requirement

-   For nouns, attach `「さえ」`or`「でさえ」`
    -   `お金さえあれば、何も出来るよ。`
    -   _The least you need is money and you can do anything_
-   For verbs, change to stem and attach `「さえ」`
    -   `自分の過ちを認めさえしなければ、問題は解決しないよ。`
    -   _The problem won't be solved if you don't even recognize your own mistake, you know_
-   For verbs in form, attach `「さえ」`to `「て／で」`
    -   `一言言ってさえくれればこんなことにならなかった。`
    -   _If only you had said something, things wouldn't have turned out like this_

# `「（で）すら」`older version of `「（で）さえ」`

-   `この天才の私ですらわからなかった`
-   _Even a genius such a myself couldn't solve it_

# `「おろか」`it's not even worth considering

-   `結婚はおろか、２ヶ月付き合って、結局別れてしまった`
-   _We eventually broke up after going out for 2 months, much less get married_
