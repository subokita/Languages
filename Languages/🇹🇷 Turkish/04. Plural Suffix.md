# Plural Noun

-   Almost all Turkish nouns are `tekil` (singular) in nature, and form `çoğul` (plural) by adding `-ler`
    -   `aile → aileler` _(family → families)_
    -   `duygu → duygular` _(feeling → feelings)_
-   We retain final `l` in the singular noun
    -   `el → eller` _(hand → hands)_
    -   `okul → okullar` _(school → schools)_
-   We do not add plural suffix to nouns after a number, or a quanitifer like `birkaç` (some, few, several)
    -   `7 gün, 24 saat`
    -   _7 days 24 hours_
    -   `birkaç kiz ve oğlan`
    -   _several girls and boys_
-   Not all nouns are countable
    -   `bir düzine yumurta`
    -   _a dozen of eggs_
    -   `iki kavanoz bal`
    -   _two jars of honey_


# Adjective + `ler / lar`

-   We can add the plural suffix to certain adjectives to make them into plural nouns
    -   `zengin → zenginler` _(rich → the rich)_
    -   `saǧir → saǧirlar` _(deaf → the deaf)_


# Nationality + `ler / lar`

-   We can add plural suffix to nationality names
    -   `Türk → Türkler` (Turkish → the Turkish)
    -   `Alman → Almanlar` _(German → Germans)_
