# Describe Past Tense with `~던` and `~았 / ~었던`

- The use `~던` tells us:
    - You have recollection of doing something
    - You did them repeatedly in the past
    - You're still doing it at this point of time
    - `내가 지금까지 입던 옷을 내일 버릴 거야`
    - *Tomorrow, I'm going to throw out the clothes that I've been wearing until now*
- It's possible to add `~았 / 었~` between the verb stem and `~던` to denote the action has completely finished and is not currently occuring similar to past perfect's '*had*'
    - `한때 저의 손님이었던 사람이 이제는 요명한 예술가가 되었다`
    - *The person who had been my customer at one time has now become a famous artist*
