# Because of 때문

-   By placing `때문` after a noun, you mean ‘_because of (that noun)_’
    -   `일 때문에 나는 너를 못 만날 것 같아`
    -   _Because of work, I probably won’t be able to see you_
-   When `~아/어서` is added to `이다`, it will have the same meaning as _‘to be’_
    -   `남자 친구라서`
    -   _Because he’s my boyfriend_
-   When using `때문에` we are saying _‘because of that’_
    -   `남자 친구 대문에 새로운 남자를 못 만나`
    -   _Because of my boyfriend, I can’t meet another man_

# Because / Therefore ~기 때문에

-   it’s possible to place an entire clause before `때문에` instead of just a noun to indicate some events / actions occurred as the result of the clause preceding `때문에`
    -   `저는 배고프기 때문에 밥을 먹고 싶어요`
    -   _I wanna eat because I’m hungry_
-   just like `~아/어서` you can add `~기때문에` to verbs, adjectives, and `이다`
    -   `저는 행복하기 때문에 죽고 싶지 않아요`
    -   _I don’t wanna die because I’m happy (lol)_
    -   `저는 행복하지 않기 때문에 죽고 싶어요`
    -   _I want to DIE, because I’m NOT happy_

# Past Tense ~았/었기 때문에

-   `~기` should be added directly to the addition of `~았/었`
    -   `저는 시험을 못 봤기 때문에 대학고에 못 가요`
    -   _Because I did bad on a test, I won’t be able to go to the university_

# Future Tense ~ㄹ 것이기 때문에

-   Adding `~기 때문에` to a word conjugated in the future tense is simply a matter of attaching `~기 때문에` to `이다`
    -   `우리가 과거를 되짚어 볼 것이기 때문에 사진을 가져왔어요`
    -   _We’re going to be looking back at old times, so I brought some pictures_

# Other Uses of 때문

-   By adding `~기 때문에` to `그렇다`, we create `그렇기 때문에` which is commonly translated as _therefore_ or _because of that_
    -   `A: 요즘에 사람들은 그 제품을 안 사요`
    -   _A: These days, people aren’t buying that product_
    -   `B: 네, 그렇기 때문에 그 화사의 주식이 떨어지고 있어요`
    -   _B: Yes, because of that, that company’s stocks are falling_
-   By putting `때문` at the end of a sentence as noun, and adding `이다`
    -   `사람들이 너무 많이 있기 때문이야`
    -   _Because there are too many people_
-   To say what the reason is, we use `이유`
    -   `내가 방에 들어가지 않은 이유는 사람들이 너무 많이 있기 때문이야`
    -   _The reason I didn’t go to into the room is, because there are too many people_
-   We could also say that there were too many people … by adding `~았/었~` before `기`
    -   `내가 방에 들어가지 않은 이유는 사람들이 너무 많이 있었기 대문이 었어`
    -   _The reason I didn’t go into the room was, because there were too many people_
