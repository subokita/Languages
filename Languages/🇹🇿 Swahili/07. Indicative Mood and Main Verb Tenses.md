## Negation Markers in Main Verb Tenses

| Past -ku-                      | Perfect -ja-                     | Present -i                   | Future -ta-                   |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| sikuona<br>I didn’t see        | sijaona<br>I haven’t seen        | sioni<br>I don’t see         | sitaona<br>I won’t see        |
| hamkuona<br>You all didn’t see | hamjaona<br>You all haven’t seen | hamuoni<br>You all don’t see | hamtaona<br>You all won’t see |

- Before the prefix `u-` and `a-`, the negation marker `ha-` appears as `h-`
    - `Hutapotea`
    - *You will not get lost*
    - `Hatapotea`
    - *She/he will not get lost*
- However it’s maintained before the vowels of the subject pronouns for non-animates
    - `Hautapotea`
    - *It will not get lost*
    - `Haitapotea`
    - *They will not get lost*

# Habitual tense hu-

- it’s a variant of present tense, which means *usually*
- it’s expressed by marker `hu-` for all persons without subject prefix
    - `Mama / Yeye humwona asubuhi`
    - *Mother / She usually sees him in the morning*
- Or the particle `huwa` followed by regular indicative verb
    - `Huwa anamwona asubuhi`
    - She usually sees him in the morning
- The negation of it uses the particle `huwa` followed by main verb in indicative negative
    - `Huwa hatuwaoni asubuhi`
    - We usually don’t see them in the morning

# Context dependent markers and tense markers with particular connotations

## Past consecutive and emphatic tense -ka-

- `-ka-` expresses past consecutive tense, referring to an event that comes after a main verb in past or perfect tense
    - `Tulikaa chini tukaongea`
    - *We sat down and conversed*
- if the two verbs have the same subject, we use `na + infinitive`
    - `Tulikaa chini na kuongea`
    - *We sat down and conversed*
- in animate class in the singular `[mu-yu, a]` some may use the marker `ka-` to emphasize a single event that took place in recent past instead of perfect marker `-me-`
    - `Mbwa wetu kapotea`
    - *Our dog is lost*
- clauses with marker `-ka-` lack a proper negative form and instead are negated by `ha-` followed by the past or perfect markers `-ku-` or `-ja-`
    - `Hatukukaa chini wala hatukongea`
    - We did not sit down nor converse
    - `Sijafungua mlango wala sijaondoka`
    - *I have not opened the door nor left*

## The already / not yet tense: -sha-/-ja- (bado)

- The marker `-me-` of perfect tense may be enforced by the marker `-sha-` which means *already* or *yet* in interrogative clause
    - `Nimeshaona / Tumeshaona`
    - *I / we have already seen*
    - `Umeshaona / Mmeshaona`
    - *Have you / you all seen yet?*
- This corresponds to negative marker `-ja-` enforced by the adverb `bado` (not yet)
    - `Sijaona bado / Hatujaona bado`
    - *I / we have not seen yet*
    - `Sioni bado / Hatuoni bado`
    - *I / we don’t see yet*

## Secondary uses of “already” and “emphatic” tenses

- The marker `-sha-` evolved from the modal verb `kwisha` *(to finish)*
    - `Nimekwisha kuona / Tumekwisha kuona`
    - *I / we have finished seeing*
- The particle `-sha-` may be used alone with emphatic connotation or combined with emphatic marker `ka-` in 3rd person singular
    - `Alikuta dada yake kashamaliza chakula`
    - *She found out that her sister has finished the food*
- `-sha-` may also appear in combination with past tense marker `-li-` to mean *already*
    - `Unadhani alishamwona?`
    - Do you think he has already seen him?
- or with conditional `-ki-` *if/when*
    - `Bwana mkubwa akishasema nani atabisha`
    - *Once the big boss has spoken, who will dispute?*

## Using a time division noun to complement a verb

- Swahili uses 6 hours differences to say time
    - `Ninaamka saa moja asubuhi`
    - *I wake up at 7 (= 1 + 6) am*
    - `Aliondoka saa kumi na mbili jioni`
    - *He left at 6 (= 12 - 6) pm*

# Polite expressions and the use of indicative mood and infinitive form

- Use of indicative form in formal greetings
    - The expression `Hujambo` literally means *“Don’t you have any problems?”*
        - `Hujambo? Sijambo!`
        - *How are you? I am fine*
        - `Hamjambo? Hatujambo!`
        - *How are you all? We are fine*
- Infinitive and indicative forms in the expression of good byes
    - `Kwa heri ya kuonana!` (infinitive form)
    - *See you soon!*
    - `Tutaonana! Tutaonana kesho!` (indicative form)
    - *See you again! See you tomorrow!*
