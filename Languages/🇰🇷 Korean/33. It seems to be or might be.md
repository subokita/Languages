# To seems like / to be likely to

- In [[13. Different, Similar, Same]] we learned about 같다, to state that something might happen, we finish a sentence using ~ㄹ/을 것 같다
    - `나는 밥을 먹을 것이다`
    - *I will eat rice*
    - `나는 밥을 먹을 것 같다`
    - *I will probably eat rice / I might eat rice*
    - `나는 밥을 먹을지 모르겠다`
    - *I don’t know if I will eat rice*
- The subject of the sentence can be anything
    - `비가 올 것 같아`
    - *It seems like it will rain*
- This same for is also applicable on adjectives
    - `새우가 너무 비쌀 것 같아요`
    - *The shrimp will probably be too expensive*
- Using past and present conjugations before `것 같다`
    - `선생님이 열심히 공부한 것 같아요`
    - *You (teacher) probably studied hard (when you were younger)*
- Examples of being done in the past using `~ㄴ/은 것 같다`
    - `부장님이 그 일을 다 한 것 같아요`
    - *It seems that the boos already did all that work*
- Examples of being done in present using `~는 것 같다`
    - `엄마는 기다리고 있는 것 같아요`
    - *It seems as though mom is waiting now*

## Nuance of 것 같다

- `~ㄴ/은`: supposition based on evidence, what is witnessed
    - `아빠가 돈을 이미 낸 것 같아요`
    - *It seems like dad already paid*
- `~았/었을 것 같다`: blind guess
    - `아빠가 돈을 이미 냈을 것 같아요`
    - *Dad probably already paid*
- When using adjective to describe `것 같다`, `~ㄴ/은 것 같다` should be used
    - `친구가 아픈 것 같아요`
    - *It seems like my friend is hurt*
- You can attach `~았/었던` to an adjective or verb to describe noun that was probably like something in the past but not currently
    - `나의 아빠가 너무 행복했던 겟 같아`
    - *Your dad was probably very happy*
- `이다` is conjugated as an adjective, therefore `~ㄴ/은 것 같다` form should be added to it
    - `그 사람은 변대인 것 같아요`
    - *It seems like that person is a pervert*

# 그랗다 + 것 같다

- `그랄 것 같다` means *it’s probably like that*
- used to indicate something that *might be the case / probably true*
    - `다음 주 목요일은 휴가인가?`
    - *Is next Thursday a holiday?*
    - `가랄 것 같아`
    - *Probably so*
- Remember that `그렇다` is an adjective so the present conjugation is `그런 것 같다`
    - `아빠는 낚시하러 갔어요?`
    - *Did dad go fishing?*
    - `그런 것 같아요`
    - *Probably*

# Expressing Possibility with ~겠다

- most commonly used when you see or hear some fact and are stating that something must be the fact based on that evidence you saw or heard
    - `힘들 겠다!`
    - *That must be difficult!*
