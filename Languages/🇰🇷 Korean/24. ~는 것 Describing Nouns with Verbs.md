# Present Tense: Modifying Nouns with Verbs ~는 것

- When adjusting verbs to describe nouns, we must add `~는` to the stem of a verb

    - The girl who walks fast
    - `저는 과학을 좋아하는 여자들을 촣아하요`
    - *I like girls that like science*


# Past Tense (~ㄴ/은 것)

- Instead of adding `~는` to the stem of a verb, we must:
    - add `~은` to stems ending in a consonant

        - *I want to pack up the food that's left over*
    - add `~ㄴ` to stems ending in a vowel
        - `옛날에 담배를 많이 피운 환자가 많아요`
        - *There are many patients who smoked a lot in the past*


# Future Tense (~ㄹ/을 것)

- Instead of adding `~는` to the stem of a verb, we must
    - add `~을` to the stems ending in a consonant

    - add `~ㄹ` to stems ending in a vowel
        - `저는 할 일이 있어요`
