# Use of 3rd person personal suffix

-   We donâ€™t always use 3rd person personal suffix `-ler`, its use depends on the subject

## If subject is human:

-   we may omit `-ler`
    -   `Uma ve Kim istanbulâ€™da(lar). Onlar TÃ¼rkÃ§e Ã¶ÄŸreniyor(lar)`
    -   _Uma and Kim are in Istanbul. Theyâ€™re learning Turkish_
-   however we cannot omit both pronoun `onlar` and suffix `-ler`
-   We never add `-ler` to the verb if the subject is
    -   a numeral / quantifier + noun
        -   `Iki / BirkaÃ§ Ã§ocuk sokakta oynuyor`
        -   _Two / several children are playing in the street_
    -   a collective noun
        -   `Ailem Ankaraâ€™da oturuyor`
        -   _My family lives in Ankara_

## If the subject is non human:

-   we donâ€™t add `-ler` to the verb
    -   `Bu Ã§iÃ§ekler Ã§ok gÃ¼zel kokuyor`
    -   _These flowers smell so sweetly_
-   if we omit the personal pronoun `onlar`, we have to add `-ler` to the verb
    -   `Bu Ã§iÃ§ekler Ã§ok gÃ¼zel kokuyor, deÄŸil mi?`
    -   _These flowers smell so sweetly, donâ€™t they?_
    -   `Evet, Ã§ok gÃ¼zel kokuyorlar`
    -   _Yes, they smell so sweetly_

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;

# Compound subjects joined by ve or -(y)le

-   both `ve` and the suffix `-(y)le` mean _and_
-   If the subject is `sen/siz/o/onlar + ve/(y)le + ben/biz`, the verb takes 1st person plural suffix `-iz` or `-k`
    -   `Sen ve ben farklÄ±yÄ±z`
    -   _You and I are different_
    -   `Edaâ€™yla ben dÃ¼n sinemaya gittik`
    -   _Eda and I went to cinema yesterday_
-   If the subject is `o/onlar + ve/(ye)le + sen/siz`, the verb takes 2nd person plural suffix `-siniz` or `-niz`
    -   `O ve sen Ã§ok farklÄ±sÄ±nÄ±z`
    -   _She and you are very different_
    -   `Edaâ€™yla sen dÃ¼n sinemaya gittiniz mi?`
    -   _Did Eda and you go to cinema yesterday?_
-   If the subject is `noun + ve/(y)le + o/onlar` or `noun + ve/(y)le + noun`, the rules apply to the 3rd person plural suffix `-ler`
    -   `Ellerim ve ayaklarÄ±m Ã§ok Ã¼ÅŸÃ¼yor`
    -   _My hands and feet are too cold_
