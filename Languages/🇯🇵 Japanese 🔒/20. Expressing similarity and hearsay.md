# Expressing similarity with 「よう（様）」

-   When sentences end in `よう`, we must add state of being
    -   `ここには, 誰もいないようだ`
    -   _Looks like no one's here_
-   Add `の`　for nouns
    -   `学生のようだ`
    -   _Looks like it's a student_
-   Add `な`　for な adjective
    -   `ここは静かなようだ`
    -   _Looks like it's quiet_
-   Use it as `な`　adjective
    -   `彼は学生のような雰囲気ですね`
    -   _He has student like atmosphere_
-   Attach `に`　to make it ‘heard like, said like’
    -   `何も起こらなかったように言った`
    -   _Said like nothing happened_

# Using 「みたい」 to say something like something else

-   Add to noun, it conjugates like noun / `な` adjectives, NOT like　`い` adjectives
    -   `このピザはお好み焼きみたいじゃない？`
    -   _Doesn't this pizza looks like okonomiyaki?_

# Guessing outcome with 「そう」

-   Verbs must be changed to stem
    -   For `る` verbs drop the `る`
        -   `バランスが崩れて、一瞬倒れそうだった。`
        -   _Losing my balance, I seemed likely to fall for a moment_
    -   For `う` verbs, convert to /i/ sound
        -   `この辺りにありそうだけどな`
        -   _It seems likely that it would be around here, but_
-   `い` in `い` adjective must be dropped except for `いい`
    -   `この漬物はおいしそう`
    -   _This pickled vegetable looks good_
-   `いい` must first be conjugated to `よさ`
    -   `これも結構良さそうだけど、やっぱり高いよね`
    -   _This one also seems to be good, but as expected, it's expensive, huh?_
-   For all negatives, `い`　must be replaced with `さ`
    -   `これはただの試合じゃなさそうだ`
    -   _This isn't likely to be an ordinary match_
-   Doesn't work with plain nouns

# Expressing hearsay with 「そうだ」

-   Add to the end of sentence
    -   `明日、雨が降るそうだ`
    -   _I hear that it's going to rain tomorrow_
-   Add `だ`　for nouns or な　adjectives
    -   `彼は、高校生だそうです`
    -   _I hear that he's a high school student_
-   Add `だ`　when it's at beginning of a sentence
    -   `だそうです`
    -   _So I hear_

# Expressing hearsay or behavior with 「らしい」

-   `‌大人らしくするつもりだったのに、大騒ぎしてました`
-   _Despite the fact that I planned to act like an adult, I ended up making a big ruckus_

# Slang expression of similarity 「っぽい」:

-   Conjugates like `い`　adjective
    -   `恭子は全然女っぽくないね。`
    -   _Kyoko is not womanly at all, huh?_
