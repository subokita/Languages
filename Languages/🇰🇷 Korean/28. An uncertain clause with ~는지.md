# A Clause of Uncertainty `~는지`

## Present Tense

- Instead of `~는` when a clause is uncertain, we should use `~는지`
- It's common to use future tense `모르겠다` in this case
    - `저는 친구가 어디 가는지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know where my friend is going*

## Past Tense

- `~았/었` should be added to the verb at the end of uncertain clause followed by `~는지`
    - `저는 엄마가 왜 먹었는지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know why mom ate*
- In speech, it's common to hear `~ㄴ/은지` instead
    - `저는 엄마가 왜 먹은지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know why mom ate*

## Future Tense

- `~ㄹ/을` should be added to the verb at the end of uncertain clause followed by `~는지`
    - `택배가 언제 올지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know when the delivery person will come*
- When uncertain clause doesn't have a question word in it, it's common to use the word might

# Using ~는지 with adjectives

- Instead of adding `~는지`, `~ㄴ/은지` should be added, it's the same as the difference when attaching `~는` or `~ㄴ/은` to verbs and adjectives to describe an upcoming noun [24. ~는 것 Describing Nouns with Verbs](https://www.notion.so/24-Describing-Nouns-with-Verbs-8d8f8230af5543ac9c135eddbae48885)
    - `제가 준 것이 괜찮은지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know if the thing that i gave is good*
- To use this form with adjectives in past or future tenses, we can use the same rule as with verbs
    - `그 시대가 그렇게 길었는지 깨닫지 못했어요`
    - *I didn't realize that era was so long*
    - `그 일이 힘든지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know if that work will be difficult*

# If ... or not ...

- It's possible to indicate more than 1 situation by using more than 1 verb or adjective connected to `~는지`
    - `수술을 받을지 안 받을지 확실하지 않아요`
    - *I'm not sure whether I will get a surgery*
- When dealing with non `~하다` verbs, we need to write out the verb again to indicate 'or not' part, however the sentence can usually be shortened by eliminating the word before `~하다`
    - `저는 엄마가 공부했는지 안 공부했는지 모르겠어요`
    - `저는 엄마가 공부했는지 안 했는지 모르겠어요`
    - *I don't know if mom studied or not*
- It's also possible to list 2 or more outcomes that are unrelated to each other
    - `수술을 받을지 그냥 약으로 치료할지 확실하지 않아요`
    - *Not sure if I will get a surgery or just treat it with medicine*
- You can also use `~지` to form a question
    - `서울에 어떻게 가는지 알아요?`
    - *Do you know how to get to Seoul?*
- There are cases when `지` represents something certain
    - `서울에 어떻게 가는지 알아요`
    - *I know how to get to Seoul*

# Attaching `~도` to `~지`

- It can have two meanings
    - 'Too', 'also', or 'either'
        - `저뉀 밥도 먹었어요`
        - *I ate rice too*
        - `저도 밥을 먹었어요`
        - *I also ate rice*
        - `저뉀 밥도 안 먹었어요`
        - *I didn't eat rice either*
    - Nuanced meaning in the following examples
        - `내일 바가 올지 모르겠어요`
        - *It might rain tomorrow*
        - `내일 바가 올지도 모르겠어요`
        - *I don't know if it will rain tomorrow or not*
