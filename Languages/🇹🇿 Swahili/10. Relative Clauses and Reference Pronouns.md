# Relative clauses and the role of reference pronouns
- Contrastive pronoun `yeye` vs relative marker/reference pronoun `â€“ye`
	- `Mwalimu anatufundisha Kiswahili. Yeye anatoka Tanga`
	- *The teacher teaches us Swahili. He comes from Tanga.*
	- `Mwalimu anayetufundisha Kiswahili anatoka Tanga`
	- *The teacher who teaches us Swahili comes from Tanga*
- Contrastive pronoun `wao` vs relative marker/reference pronoun `-o`
	- `Walimu wanatufundisha Kiswahili. Wao wanatoka Tanga`
	- *The teachers teach us Swahili. They come from Tanga*

# Three Forms of Relative Constructions in Swahili
## Relative clauses with the conjunction amba-
- subject relative with `amba-`: `amba-Relative + Verb`
	- Subclass [ki-ki] (-cho)
		- `Kitabu ambacho kinafundisha kusoma ni hiki`
		- *The book which teaches reading is this one*
	- Subclass [mu-yu,a] (-ye)
		- `Mtoto ambaye anapenda kusoma ni huyu`
		- *The child who likes to read is this one*
- object relative with `-amba`: `amba-Relative + Verb/Object marker`
	- Subclass [ki-ki] (-cho)
		- `Kitabu ambacho ninakisoma ni hiki`
		- *The book that I am reading is this one*
	- Subclass [mu-yu,a] (-ye)
		- `Mtoto ambaye ninampenda ni huyu`
		- *The child whom I like is this one*
- `amba-` is only used in the presence of the noun it refers to or a pronoun that stands for it
	- `Watoto ambao wanapenda kusoma watafaulu`
	- *The children who like to read will succeed*
	- `Wote ambao wanapenda kusoma watafaulu`
	- *All who like to read will succeed*
- in the absence of the referred noun, the demonstrative `-le` is typically used
	- `Wale ambao wanapenda kusoma watafaulu`
	- *Those who like to read will succeed*
	- `Yule ambaye anapenda kusoma atafaulu`
	- *The one who likes to read will succeed*
- English conjunction *whose*, in relative clauses, corresponds to the pattern `of whom / which + noun + possessive`
	- `Ninajua nchi ambayo mshiriki wake ameshinda`
	- *I know the country whose candidate has won*
