# Changing verbs to nouns ~기

- You can use 기 to turn a clause into noun, but you can't use it to describe noun
    - `나의 여자 친구는 내가 사과를 가져오기를 원해`
    - *My girlfriend wants me to bring apples*

## ~기 시작하다

- To state that one starts to do something
    - `이상한 행동을 한 다음에 사람들이 저를 쳐다보기 시작했어요`
    - *After acting strangly, people started staring at me*

## ~기 실하다

- To indicate you don't want to do something
    - `쌀을 씻기 싫어요`
    - *I don't want to wash the rice*

## Actual Words

- There are handful of words, where it's common to use ~기 form as an actual word
    - `저는 줄넘기를 못해요`
    - *I'm bad at rope skipping*

## Making Lists

- When making list of things, it's common to end the phrase with `~기`
    - `커피를 만들기` *(make coffee)*
    - `책상을 정리하기` *(organize my desk)*
    - `방 청소하고` *(clean the room)*

# Buttons

- On computer, menu items are generally written with nouns + `~기` form instead of verbs
    - `보내기` *(send)*

# Changing Verbs / Adjectives to Nouns ~ㅁ/음

- Main usage of `~ㅁ/음` is to turn single words into nouns
    - `싸우다 → 사움` *(to fight → a fight)*
    - `아프다 → 아픔` *(to be sick or in pain → pain)*
    - `나는 형이랑 싸움에서 이곘어`
    - *I won in a fight with my brother*
- This form can be used to change entire sentence into noun forms, just like `~는것`
    - `나는 네가 먹고 있는 것을 알았어`
    - *I knew you were eating*
    - `나는 네가 먹고 있음을 알았어`
    - *I knew you were eating*
- In [[21. This, That, That]] we learn about `그렇다` which means *like that*. `~ㅁ/음` is commonly added as confirmation (e.g. *yeah, of course*)
    - `차를 스스로 주차했어요?`
    - *Did you park the car by yourself?*
    - `그럼요`
    - *Yes (it's like that)*
